            Interior Design's Market Live 2018 Introduces Designers to New Brands
            On the eve of NYCxDesign, brands offered designers a look at their
            latest offerings at Interior Design's Market Live event on May 9.
            A curated selection of companies presented their textiles, lighting,
            furniture, and more to more than 100 designer guests at the magazine's
            New York City headquarters. The evening offered an opportunity for specifiers
            to learn about new manufacturers in the marketplace while mingling with fellow
            industry professionals over drinks and bites. It also was a chance to tour Sandow's
            new Manhattan office, which Interior Design moved into late last year. The gathering
            was an intimate and inspiring way to get in the spirit of design before a stimulating
            few weeks of products and parties.
